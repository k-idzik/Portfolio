                <h2>DIRECTX ENGINE</h2>
                <p>
                    Worked with two other individuals on a DirectX graphics engine.
                    As a team, we worked on implementing gameplay features before moving into the core focus of the project, graphics programming.

                <h2>BLACKFEATHER</h2>
                <p>
                    Gameplay programmer on an 8 person team with the ultimate goal of exhibiting the game at Imagine RIT 2017.
                    Responsible for implementing core features of the game in an efficient manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blackfeather was conceived as a grand project where players would control a parrot who has the ability to control individual pirates in the game as they fight over treasure.
                    This quickly became AI heavy, had issues with custom camera work, and generally wasn't coming along to provide the fun and solid gameplay experience we were hoping for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blackfeather was an interesting experience, where in the middle of the 15 week development period we were able to discern that we wouldn't be able to continue with the game we had originally planned and make it fun before the final deadline.
                    As such, we pivoted to a new idea which utilized the same theme and art assets while also being attainable from a programming standpoint within the time remianing.
                    This new version of Blackfeather stripped out AI entirely, instead becoming a two player split-screen turn-based pirate racing game.
                    At Imagine RIT, it proved to be a popular game, especially with children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the initial version of Blackfeather, I worked on the camera, parrot interaction with items on the map, and parrot-pirate switching.
                    In the final version of Blackfeather, I implimented features such as traps and trap interaction, with some code from the previous version being carried over.

                <p>
                    Worked as part of a two-man team on a JavaScript canvas game where players use a slingshot to protect a sleeping sloth from falling rocks.
