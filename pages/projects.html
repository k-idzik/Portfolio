                    <h2>OPENGL ENGINE</h2>
                    <p>I've been working on an OpenGL engine as the final project for a Data Structures class. A basic outline of how to complete the engine was provided, but most of the code was left up to students to figure out for themselves. Design choices were also left up to the student, allowing for many different projects running many different games. For my game, I went with a small bowling simulation, implementing collision detection and resolution, model loading, and lighting, along the way. This engine will certainly continue to be a work-in-progress for some time, with one immediate goal being to swap out the current instructor-provided models with my own models.</p>

                    <h2>TUTORIAL WEBSITE</h2>
                    <p>I created a Minecraft command block tutorial that implements teams for a Web Design class, which required some sort of step-by-step tutorial in a format friendly to different screen resolutions. I chose the Minecraft topic because it was something I was already familliar with, but also could be updated due to changes that had recently occured in the game. I used a div based navigation system, which seemed great at the time, but could have probably been implemented much easier and with more extensibility using a list based approach. I used many images and supporting text to give clear directions to interested users, and tried to keep with a light-colored theme and readable font. Overall, I would say I'm happy with how this project turned out, but I would approach some mobile design choices differently if I were to revisit this project.</p>

                    <h2>FLOCKING SIMULATION</h2>
                    <p>I created this flocking kitten simulation in Unity as a final project for an Interactive Media class, and while most of the code is my own, some scripts were provided to me by the instructor. Transitioning from 2D to 3D, I used models built into Unity or from the Unity Asset Store so I could maintain a focus on the code behind the simulation. In this simulation, a flock of kittens (I wanted to use seagulls, but sadly they would only run away) chase a butterfly around a small park scene. The kittens and butterfly are programmed to follow a set path around the area marked with custom path nodes, and avoid certain obstacles marked with custom obstacle objects. In their flocking formation, the kittens use different flocking methods to keep from bumping into each other or venturing off too far from the group. For the observer of the simulation, you have the option of using a first person controller to walk around the scene, or pressing space to switch between multiple different cameras.</p>

                    <h2>HUMANS VS. ZOMBIES</h2>
                    <p>I worked on Humans vs. Zombies on for an Interactive Media class. Humans vs. Zombies presents the user with several humans and a zombie in a park setting. Both parties are confined in the park and must avoid the trees within it, feats achieved using different flocking algorithms. The zombies chase down the humans, while the humans futilely attempt to flee the zombies. Users can influence this simulation, using the left mouse button to add more humans, and the right mouse button to add more zombies. Pressing spacebar will also allow you to see the different vectors coming off of each flocker.</p>

                    <h2>MOONMAN</h2>
                    <p>MoonMan is a project I worked on for an Interactive Media class. MoonMan was implemented in Processing in around a week, and was designed to include general random algorithms, Perlin noise, and Gaussian distribution. The general goal of MoonMan is to avoid being hit by the oncoming rocks, which will speed up as the game progresses. Players can either jump over the rocks by holding down the spacebar, or shoot the rock by pressing enter. Shooting the rock will net you 100 points, but while jumping over the rock awards you no points, it could be useful as you must reload between shots. Getting hit by the rock will remove 250 points from your score, whereas holding down the spacebar in an attempt to outsmart the oncoming rocks will loose you one point per frame you are at the top of the MoonMan's jump. I'd like to revisit this project in the future, where I'd rework jumping to work in a more traditional manner and add other mechanics to make the game more interesting.</p>
